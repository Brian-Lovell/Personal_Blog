## Structure
- Portfolio completely separates structure from design/style.
- There are no attributes present in the body of the document.
- There are no elements in the document.

*:white_check_mark: The portfolio completely separates structure from design/style.*

*:white_check_mark: There are no attributes present in the body of the document.*

*:white_check_mark: There are no elements in the document.*

**There should be at least 3 imported files in the main CSS file, but the student is welcome to break it down even further if that makes it easier for them.**

**Files are organized with a directory structure that separates files based on page and functionality.**

*The files were organized in a perfect directory structure. :clap:*

**There is an intentional user flow on each page with appropriate links as needed.**

*The user flow is consitent and perfect between the pages. :clap:*

## Design
**Custom images, layout, and styling.**

Great job designing your webpage without using any external frameworks:clap::clap:

**Typography: Custom design for typography with at least 3 unique properties for each typography selector**
- Headers (h1 to h3 at minimum)
- Paragraph Text
- a. Bold
- b. Italic
- c. Underlined
- Links 
- Quotes
- Colors: At least 3 colors are used.

**The following are used in the webpage:**

- Image(s)
- Image caption
- Buttons
- Card
*All of these were used on the website. Great job! :clap:*

**The general pattern of the webpage should be as follows:**

Blog Homepage
Navbar
Blog Post Card
Card
Image
Buttons
Footer
Blog Post
Header
Author Info
Name
Title
Current Company/School
Short Bio
Avatar
Social Sharing
Twitter
Facebook
LinkedIn

**The following pages should be present:**

Blog Homepage
Blog Post
*Both of these pages were present. Great job adding more pages and creating a great beautiful website. :tada:*

## Layout
Uses Flexbox at least twice throughout the project to create a component or pattern

*The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning. Keep it up!*

**Uses CSS Grid at least twice throughout the project to create the layout for pages**

## Responsiveness
Pages are mobile-friendly and display correctly on all display sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Note: You can simulate Mobile Devices with Device Mode in Chrome DevTools.

Great job! The pages are mobile-friendly. :clap:



## Quality
**HTML5 semantic tags such as header, footer, article, section , etc. are used to add meaning to the code.**
**No div or section selectors are without a CSS class or id.**
*Well done using semantic elements in your project. :tada:*
*This helps structure the code we create, making it more readable and easier to maintain. These elements also clearly describe its meaning to both the browser and the developer.*

- All code is lowercase
- The code does not have trailing white spaces.
- Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).
- Code uses a new line for every block, list or table element and indent every such child element (it is acceptable to put all elements in one line).
- When quoting attribute values, code uses consistent quotation marks (single vs. double).

*Code does use a new line for every block. Great job.*

- HTML documents HTML5 doctype html
- Code omits type attributes for style sheets and scripts.
- [Optional] Code does not use entity references unless necessary e.g. characters with special meaning (like < and &) as well as control or “invisible” characters (like no-break spaces).

- The code does not have trailing white spaces.
- Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).
- Code indents all content, that is rules within rules as well as declarations to reflect hierarchy and improve understanding.
- The code uses a semicolon after every declaration for consistency and extensibility reasons.
- Code always uses a space after a property name's colon, but no space between property and colon, for consistency reasons.
- Code always uses a single space between the last selector and the opening brace that begins the declaration block. Code always start a new line for each selector and declaration.
- Code always put a blank line (two line breaks) between rules.
- Code uses consistent quotation marks for attribute selectors or property values (single vs. double).
*The indentation is perfectly done. Great job! :clap:*

- The code uses meaningful or generic ID and class names that are as short as possible, but as long as necessary.
- The code does not use element names in conjunction with IDs or classes.
- The code uses shorthand properties where possible.
- [Optional] Code omits unit specification after 0 values.
- [Optional] Code includes leading 0s in decimal values for readability.
- [Optional] Code uses 3-character hexadecimal notation where possible.
- [Optional] Code separates words in ID and class names by a hyphen.

*Great job! The code met all these specifications. :clap:*
